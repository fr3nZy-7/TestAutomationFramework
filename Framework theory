Theory -

benefits of using a framework
(folder structure in eclipse related benefits) - test engineers
1. Reusability of code/functions
2. Easy Maintenance 
3. Scalability
(benefits outside the folder structure) - test framework designers
4. Manageable Test Data, logical segregation of test data
5. Remove external dependencies - e.g using maven to remove jar file dependency
6. Repository Management
7. Build process
8. Continuous Integration



jenkins.war file command -
java -jar jenkins.war


devOps - 
Planning->Coding>Build (dev env)> unit testing> build (test env)> Testing > Release  > Deploy


@Parameter annotation is used to pass a parameter from textng.xml file




Framework explained ->

Config file->
Config file will contain the data which will remain same throughout the execution
xml file will contain data that will change from one test to another test
excel file will contain data that will change for each iteration of test case


driver file ->
Driver file will run before test
xls reader is declare here as we will require the test data reader throughout the execution, no new object need to be changed
ChromeOptions class is used to customise ChromeBrowser, similarly we have firefox and edge options class
 
Library package- Application library->
Applicaiton library will contain all reusable functions used by the application, example capture screenshot
